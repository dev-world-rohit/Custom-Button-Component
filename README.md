# Custom-Button-Component
This is projects shows how to make a custom component that other developers can also use easily.

## What I have Learned from This Project
**1. Creating a Custom Button Component:** I've created a custom Button component that accepts various props, such as primary, secondary, success, warning, danger, outline, and rounded. This allows me to create buttons with different styles and variations.

**2. Using PropTypes:** I've defined PropTypes for the Button component to ensure that the props are used correctly. I've also added a custom PropTypes validator to check that only one of the variation props is selected.

**3. Styling with Tailwind CSS:** I'm using the twMerge function from Tailwind CSS to merge and generate classes based on the props passed to the Button component. This approach allows me to easily apply different styles to the buttons.

**4. Handling Events:** I've included event handlers, such as onClick, onMouseEnter, and onMouseLeave, to demonstrate how to handle user interactions with the buttons.

**5. Component Composition:** This App component demonstrates how to use the Button component in different scenarios, creating variations of buttons with different styles and interactions.

**6. Functional Components:** All of the components (Button, App, and the event handlers) are functional components, which is the preferred way to create components in modern React.
